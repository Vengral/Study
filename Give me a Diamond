Task
You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).

Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.

Examples
A size 3 diamond:

 *
***
 *


def diamond(n):

    if n%2==0 or n<=0:
        return None
    
    stars = list(range(1,n,2)) + list(range(n,0,-2))
    spaces = [(n-star)//2  for star in stars]   
    
    return "".join((f'{space* " "}{star*"*"}\n' for space,star in zip(spaces,stars)))
